  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={A survey of Bayesian Network structure learning},
  abstract={Bayesian Networks (BNs) have become increasingly popular over the last few decades as a tool for reasoning under uncertainty in fields as diverse as medicine, biology, epidemiology, economics and the social sciences. This is especially true in real-world areas where we seek to answer complex questions based on hypothetical evidence to determine actions for intervention. However, determining the graphical structure of a BN remains a major challenge, especially when modelling a problem under causal assumptions. Solutions to this problem include the automated discovery of BN graphs from data, constructing them based on expert knowledge, or a combination of the two. This paper provides a comprehensive review of combinatoric algorithms proposed for learning BN structure from data, describing 74 algorithms including prototypical, well-established and state-of-the-art approaches. The basic approach of each algorithm is described in consistent terms, and the similarities and differences between them highlighted. Methods of evaluating algorithms and their comparative performance are discussed including the consistency of claims made in the literature. Approaches for dealing with data noise in real-world datasets and incorporating expert knowledge into the learning process are also covered.},

  abstract={Learning from data that contain missing values represents a common phenomenon in many domains. Relatively few Bayesian Network structure learning algorithms account for missing data, and those that do tend to rely on standard approaches that assume missing data are missing at random, such as the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm. Because missing data are often systematic, there is a need for more pragmatic methods that can effectively deal with data sets containing missing values not missing at random. The absence of approaches that deal with systematic missing data impedes the application of BN structure learning methods to real-world problems where missingness are not random. This paper describes three variants of greedy search structure learning that utilise pairwise deletion and inverse probability weighting to maximally leverage the observed data and to limit potential bias caused by missing values. The first two of the variants can be viewed as sub-versions of the third and best performing variant, but are important in their own in illustrating the successive improvements in learning accuracy. The empirical investigations show that the proposed approach outperforms the commonly used and state-of-the-art Structural EM algorithm, both in terms of learning accuracy and efficiency, as well as both when data are missing at random and not at random.},

  abstract={Numerous Bayesian Network (BN) structure learning algorithms have been proposed in the literature over the past few decades. Each publication makes an empirical or theoretical case for the algorithm proposed in that publication and results across studies are often inconsistent in their claims about which algorithm is ‘best’. This is partly because there is no agreed evaluation approach to determine their effectiveness. Moreover, each algorithm is based on a set of assumptions, such as complete data and causal sufficiency, and tend to be evaluated with data that conforms to these assumptions, however unrealistic these assumptions may be in the real world. As a result, it is widely accepted that synthetic performance overestimates real performance, although to what degree this may happen remains unknown. This paper investigates the performance of 15 state-of-the-art, well-established, or recent promising structure learning algorithms. We propose a methodology that applies the algorithms to data that incorporates synthetic noise, in an effort to better understand the performance of structure learning algorithms when applied to real data. Each algorithm is tested over multiple case studies, sample sizes, types of noise, and assessed with multiple evaluation criteria. This work involved learning approximately 10,000 graphs with a total structure learning runtime of seven months. In investigating the impact of data noise, we provide the first large scale empirical comparison of BN structure learning algorithms under different assumptions of data noise. The results suggest that traditional synthetic performance may overestimate real-world performance by anywhere between 10% and more than 50%. They also show that while score-based learning is generally superior to constraint-based learning, a higher fitting score does not necessarily imply a more accurate causal graph. The comparisons extend to other outcomes of interest, such as runtime, reliability, and resilience to noise, assessed over both small and large networks, and with both limited and big data. To facilitate comparisons with future studies, we have made all data, raw results, graphs and BN models freely available online.}
